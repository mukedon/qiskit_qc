# Introduction

This project provides foundational work on quantum computing, quantum error detection and quantum circuits, using Ramsey interferometry as a physical setup. 

Various selected topics on applying Qiskit to practical quantum computing problems are also being discussed as Use-Cases.

On further stages [Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods](https://github.com/serkosi/quantum-entanglement) specifically for modeling and analyzing complex systems, including chaotic systems and attractors are planned to be implemented as application in this project.

## Good To Know's
### 1. [Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)](https://duckbucks.com/a/cracking-the-quantum-future-of-finance)
A method that uses quantum interaction to model random processes. Instead of trying to directly solve the entire quantum system, QMC generates many random "paths" or "samples" through possible states, and then statistically estimates important properties such as risks between assets.

How QMC works:
- QMC simulates a large number of possible scenarios that a quantum system might experience.
- Each path represents one possible realization according to quantum rules.
- By averaging across many paths, QMC approximates quantities that would otherwise be too complex to calculate exactly.

### 3. [Bloch Sphere Simulator](https://bloch.kherb.io/)
- Hadamard gate (H)
- Pauli gate (X,Y,Z)
- Phase gate (S,St,T,Tt), conditional
- H, X, Y, Z, S, St are under the Clifford gate set since they keep it on an axis.
    S, St pi/2
    T, Tt pi/4
