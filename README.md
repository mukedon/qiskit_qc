## 1. [Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)](https://duckbucks.com/a/cracking-the-quantum-future-of-finance)
A method that uses quantum interaction to model random processes. Instead of trying to directly solve the entire quantum system, QMC generates many random "paths" or "samples" through possible states, and then statistically estimates important properties such as risks between assets.

How QMC works:
- QMC simulates a large number of possible scenarios that a quantum system might experience.
- Each path represents one possible realization according to quantum rules.
- By averaging across many paths, QMC approximates quantities that would otherwise be too complex to calculate exactly.

- Hadamard gate (H)
- Pauli gate (X,Y,Z)
- Phase gate (S,St,T,Tt), conditional
- H, X, Y, Z, S, St are under the Clifford gate set since they keep it on an axis.

S, St pi/2
T, Tt pi/4
